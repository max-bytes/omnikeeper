# GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is the central interface for external services to interact with omnikeeper and its data.

To interactively explore the GraphQL API and build queries, the technical frontend of omnikeeper provides an interactive GraphGL playground available at `/graphql-playground`. This frontend is based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and provides a documentation explorer too.
