# GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is the central interface for external services to interact with omnikeeper and its data.

The GraphQL API is available at [backend-url]/graphql

To interactively explore the GraphQL API and build queries and mutations, the technical frontend of omnikeeper provides an interactive GraphGL playground available at `[frontend-url]/graphql-playground`. This frontend is based on [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and provides a documentation explorer too.
